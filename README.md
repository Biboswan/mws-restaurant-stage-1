### Setup

1. run `npm install`

2. run `gulp`

3. server running on `http://localhost:3000` with browser sync

4. Server can be also run after gulp produced the buildfile as follows

   1. cd `dist`

   2. run `http-server -g`

### Note:

You need to have [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) and gulp cli already installed in your system.
`npm install http-server -g`
Brower sync at `port 3000` might interfere with audit scores.
